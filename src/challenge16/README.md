# Longest Pandigital Prime Number - Project Euler

A [pandigital number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandigital_number) is a number that uses each digit once, for example 

1234567890 is a pandigital number, it uses each number once
1234 is a pandigital number, it uses each number once
1233 is not a pandigital number, it uses 3 twice
122233 is not pandigital, it uses 2 three times, and 3 two times

You will create a function(s) that accepts a integer, generates a list of prime numbers to that integer then returns the longest pandigital prime number of that list of prime numbers.
