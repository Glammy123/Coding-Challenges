# Square Root Calculation

Do what the title says :3, no built in square root functions, it should be able to accept numbers like 13 which have no square perfect root and compute one. Use Heronâ€™s method for the easiest solution.

## Examples

```python
square_root(9) == 3
square_root(13) == 3.605551275463989
```
