# Coding Challenges

This is a compilation of my programming challenges along with some solutions in multiple languages. I try to provide a acceptable solution for each problem but I am not perfect, feel free to add better or your own solutions by creating a pull request. The challenges are not in any particular order, so feel free to jump around and try to solve them. All challenges are language agnostic, so you can solve them in any language you like.

## General Steps to Add a New Challenge
You can also add new challenges! However, please follow the format of the existing challenges.

- Fork the repository
- if you want to add a new challenge called "New Challenge", you would create a folder called `challenge{number}`
- Inside the folder, you would create a `README.md` file with the challenge description
    - you will put the challenge name as the title with a # {name (New Challenge)}
    - you will put the challenge description as the first paragraph
    - you will put the example test/output as a code block
- You would also create an `answers.md` file with the solutions
    - you will put the solutions in this general format
        - ## {Language}
        - ```{language}
        - {code}
        - ```
- Add the challenge to the `SUMMARY.md` file
- Create a pull request
