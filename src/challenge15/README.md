# Circular Primes - Project Euler

Basically, you generate prime numbers for a given range, then you compute all the rotations for that number, for example "197" can be "197", "971", or "719", you will return a list of those numbers that are valid circular primes, if you have issues, just google circular primes and there is guides and stuff to help!
